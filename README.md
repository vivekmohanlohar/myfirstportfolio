# myfirstportfolio
First time I tried to create a portfolio website for myself using my web development skills at that time I searched a lot for portfollio website examples and I found a portfoion website of Britteny Chiang she is a web developer shea has a very good portfolio website so I decided to create the same as her. Then I started creating it with my smartphone never had that much difficulty while creating an website ever because I was on my smartphne and also Galaxy M01 core you can search for it.
Currently I have the most advance version of this site

This repository was on the other site which was my older gihub profile I stoppped using it and I got to know today that I have that accound also so I logged in to that account. I got to see this I was not remembering the site i thought I have deleted this site but it was there... Got emmotional while seeing this because it was the most difficult and my first attempt of making a website directly from the scratch I wanteed to presearve this repo so i Uploaded it here...
You can see this site here...
